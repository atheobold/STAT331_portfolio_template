Currently, I believe that I deserve a C in the class. Although I have demonstrated understanding of some of the learning objectives, I haven't been giving enough attention to the revisions, I haven't been able to do peer reviews as of late because my labs have been getting submitted late, and I'm overall not putting enough effort into this class. I hope to raise my grade to a C in the final portfolio, but as of now I don't have enough proof to say that I have mastered more than half of the content in the class. As of now, I can select, filter, and modify existing variables so that I can pull out and visualize the correct information. This can be seen in Lab 3 when I mutate the ethnic variable to "white" and "non-white", and when I use filter, group by, and slice min/max. Additionally, I converted the variables sex and ethnic to factors. Furthermore, I can use the summarize function to pull out things like mean_weight as seen in Lab 5. I can also use mutating joins as seen in Lab 4, which is also an example of efficient and tidy code that doesn't repeat itself while also reducing repetition. I also used a filtering join in Lab 4 when I used semi_join to pull out the major regions in the data. For creating a professional looking quarto document that has also reflected my growth as a data scientist, I refer to my Lab 3 revisions. I revised the lab so that library outputs are no longer present in the html file, I added more to the description of the data, and used other functions than print to display information.Â I need to work writing robust programs that are resistant to changes in inputs because I mainly use the names of variables. I can also create visualizations for a variety of variable types and add creative elements to them. In Lab 2, I was able to create scatterplots for two numeric variables. In Lab 5, I learned about how to reorder the box plots to increase insightfulness and moved the y-axis to the top of the graph so that it is more legible. I also collapsed Monday through Friday into the groups 'weekend' and 'weekday' to allow viewers to see the difference more clearly. In Lab 4, I used columns to represent the proportion of avocado sold in each of the Californian regions. Although my graph did not match the one in the instructions, I came very close and will fix it on the final draft of the portfolio. Regarding committing to continued learning, I feel as though I have been slacking in that aspect. I do feel like I have grown as a team member and leader, by helping facilitate the group work. I listen to my team members respectfully and help when needed. I did miss one Thursday, which is also why I believe that I am sitting at a D. I have contributed to creating a respectful classroom learning by not making stereotypes about people and truly listening and communicating with those around me. Furthermore, I have been active in my teams group chat and have worked with them outside of class to help them and myself with various activities. As a business major, it has been awesome to be surrounded by so many different majors and skill sets. I don't feel like I have been accomplishing all the goals that I outlined for myself because I believe I have been lacking in effort.
