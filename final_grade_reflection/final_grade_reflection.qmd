## **Reflection:** 

As stated previously, I believe that I earned a C- in the class. I believe that I have hit majority of the learning targets, as argued above with evidence in the supporting artifacts section. Although I don\'t think I\'ve mastered all the one\'s referenced, I believe the evidence that I have provided gives enough evidence towards a C-.

Additionally, I revised my thinking in a lot of the labs and challenges throughout the class and got successes on all of them except Lab 7, Lab 4, and Challenge 4. I edited Lab 7 and Lab 4 for final revisions in the portfolio. I also completed all the Preview and Practice Activities with overall success. They were late majority of the time, however, which is why I believe that I earned a C-. Additionally, when I learned new ways to do things or ways to make better Quarto documentation, I included them in my work going forward, as seen in the final Lab 9. Additionally, Extended Learning is the reason why I believe I deserve a C- instead of a C or C+. Throughout the class, I always did the bare minimum in my labs and challenges to get the success without including things that show extended learning outside of class. I hope to continue my learning with R, Quarto, and Github going forward now that I have a very solid basis comprehension of the material.

Regarding participation, I always came to class with the coursework and preview activities complete. I was able to assist my group in our thinking and help others. I worked on labs with teammates outside of class and helped in our group chat when I could. I really enjoyed my group and felt like I made an impact by being in the group. Furthermore, I was able to I was absent for two class periods, which also adds to why I deserve a C- in the class instead of a higher grade.
