Currently, I believe that I deserve a D in the class. Although I have
demonstrated understanding of some of the learning objectives, I
haven\textquotesingle t been giving enough attention to the revisions, I
haven\textquotesingle t been able to do peer reviews as of late because
my labs have been getting submitted late, and I\textquotesingle m
overall not putting enough effort into this class. I hope to raise my
grade to a C in the final portfolio, but as of now I
don\textquotesingle t have enough proof to say that I have mastered more
than half of the content in the class. As of now, I can select, filter,
and modify existing variables so that I can pull out and visualize the
correct information. This can be seen in Lab 3 when I mutate the ethnic
variable to "white" and "non-white", and when I use filter, group by,
and slice min/max. Additionally, I converted the variables sex and
ethnic to factors. Furthermore, I can use the summarize function to pull
out things like mean\_weight as seen in Lab 5. I can also use mutating
joins as seen in Lab 4, which is also an example of efficient and tidy
code that doesn\textquotesingle t repeat itself while also reducing
repetition. I also used a filtering join in Lab 4 when I used semi\_join
to pull out the major regions in the data. For creating a professional
looking quarto document that has also reflected my growth as a data
scientist, I refer to my Lab 3 revisions. I revised the lab so that
library outputs are no longer present in the html file, I added more to
the description of the data, and used other functions than print to
display information.~I need to work writing robust programs that are
resistant to changes in inputs because I mainly use the names of
variables. I can also create visualizations for a variety of variable
types and add creative elements to them. In Lab 2, I was able to create
scatterplots for two numeric variables. In Lab 5, I learned about how to
reorder the box plots to increase insightfulness and moved the y-axis to
the top of the graph so that it is more legible. I also collapsed Monday
through Friday into the groups
\textquotesingle weekend\textquotesingle{} and
\textquotesingle weekday\textquotesingle{} to allow viewers to see the
difference more clearly. In Lab 4, I used columns to represent the
proportion of avocado sold in each of the Californian regions. Although
my graph did not match the one in the instructions, I came very close
and will fix it on the final draft of the portfolio. Regarding
committing to continued learning, I feel as though I have been slacking
in that aspect. I do feel like I have grown as a team member and leader,
by helping facilitate the group work. I listen to my team members
respectfully and help when needed. I did miss one Thursday, which is
also why I believe that I am sitting at a D. I have contributed to
creating a respectful classroom learning by not making stereotypes about
people and truly listening and communicating with those around me.
Furthermore, I have been active in my teams group chat and have worked
with them outside of class to help them and myself with various
activities. As a business major, it has been awesome to be surrounded by
so many different majors and skill sets. I don\textquotesingle t feel
like I have been accomplishing all the goals that I outlined for myself
because I believe I have been lacking in effort.

I apologize I wasn't able to supply the artifacts. ~

In complete candidness, I have been struggling with a lot this quarter.
My family has been having a crisis, and it has really taken a toll on my
work and mental health. My mom has been drinking again and it has really
torn my family apart. I want to finish strong and hopefully raise my
grade to a C. I don\textquotesingle t say this out of pity, but I just
want to reach out and ask for help because I really need some right now.
I\textquotesingle m feeling stuck in a hole, and I need some guidance on
how I can achieve a C. I also want to apologize because I know that you
have a heavy workload and I have been submitting things late, submitting
random revisions, and just not meeting you halfway. I think your an
awesome teacher that really cares about their students. When we chat, I
hope you can help me can come up with a game plan to do this.
